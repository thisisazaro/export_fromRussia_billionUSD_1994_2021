# Abstract
This study analyzes the time series representing the total export volume from Russia in billion USD from 1994 to 2021. The research involves data visualization, stationarity testing, data transformation, and forecasting using various models, including ETS, SARIMA, Theta method, and Random Forest. The models are compared to determine the most accurate one, residuals are analyzed, and a two-year forecast is generated. Additionally, the study examines anomalies and structural shifts in the data.

# Research Questions
- Is the export time series stationary?
- What data transformation (if any) improves forecasting accuracy?
- Which models provide the most accurate export predictions?
- Does combining multiple models improve forecast accuracy compared to individual models?
- What are the main anomalies or structural changes in export data?
- What is the forecast for the next two years based on historical trends?
